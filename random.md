# yamalapi-lang

```yml 
user:
  id: u8
  name:
    first_name: string
    last_name: string
  email: string
  active: boolean
```

wish i could have this automatically converted to rust and other similar properties that would allow me to build a full
production api using yml and have a cli tool that even watches my yml file and reruns the rust server
